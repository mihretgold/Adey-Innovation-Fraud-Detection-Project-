## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-project.git
    cd adey-innovation-fraud-detection-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the database:**
    Configure your database connection in `src/api/models.py`.

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python src/api/app.py
    ```

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing

1. **Data Analysis:**
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
    - Use visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to gain insights into the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values by imputation or removal.
    - Clean the data to remove duplicates and outliers.
    - Perform feature engineering to create new relevant features.
    - Normalize and scale features to bring them to a similar range.
    - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. **Merging Datasets:**
    - Integrate different datasets (e.g., geolocation data) to enhance the feature set and improve model performance.

## Model Building and Training

1. **Model Selection:**
    - Choose appropriate models for fraud detection, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

2. **Model Training:**
    - Train and evaluate models on the prepared datasets. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
    - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

3. **MLOps Steps:**
    - Implement versioning and experiment tracking using tools like MLflow to keep track of different model versions and their performance metrics.

## Model Explainability

1. **SHAP:**
    - Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions and identify the most influential features.
    - Generate SHAP values for individual predictions and visualize them to understand the contribution of each feature.

2. **LIME:**
    - Use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for local model interpretability.
    - Generate LIME explanations for individual predictions to understand the local decision boundaries of the model.

## Model Deployment and API Development

1. **Flask API:**
    - Develop a REST API using Flask to serve the trained models.
    - Define endpoints for prediction, model information, and health checks.

    ```sh
    pip install flask
    ```

2. **Dockerization:**
    - Containerize the Flask application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
    - Create a `Dockerfile` to define the Docker image and use `docker-compose` for managing multiple services.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.8-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    EXPOSE 5000
    CMD ["python", "src/api/app.py"]
    ```

3. **Deploy the application:**
    - Use a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to deploy the Docker container and make the API accessible over the internet.
